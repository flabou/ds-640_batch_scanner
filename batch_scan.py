Simple script for brother DS-640, to scan files in a batch. Sane's scanimage has
a batch mode command, but it doesn't work with this printer because the batch 
scan stops when the feeder is empty, and the DS-640 doesn't have a real feeder
(only one document is present in the "feeder").

The scanning occurs in the following steps:
    1. Scan images as long as the user asks for it, in 300dpi resolution in 
       separate tiff image files.
    2. For each page, perform OCR on the document using tesseract in hocr format,
       then convert hocr file to djvu compatible hidden text format.
    3. If the output config is set to bitonal (currently the only mode 
       implemented), convert the file to .pbm image format which is expected by
       cjb2 for djvu conversion.
    4. Convert files to djvu, and merge them with respective ocr
    5. Merge all djvu files to a single multipage file.
    6. Remove temporary files.

To add:
    metadata (scan date in djvu hidden text)

dependencies:
    - sane and the scanimage command to perform the scan
    - tesseract to perform ocr on the pdf file
    - magick to convert image from one format to another
    - beautifulsoup to parse hocr file and convert it to djvu txt file
